  We introduce MTNeuro, a multi-task neuroimaging benchmark built on volumetric, micrometer-resolution X-ray microtomography of mouse thalamocortical regions. The benchmark spans diverse prediction tasks—including brain-region classification and microstructure segmentation—and offers insights into the representation capabilities of supervised and self-supervised models across multiple abstraction levels.
